I am a Ph.D. student in the department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at the [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). My advisor is Professor [Yexiang Xue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/).

I am broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics. I work on designing and building intelligent learning agents (e.g., RL) which can make interpretable critical decisions under uncertainty.
